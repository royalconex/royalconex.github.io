### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite because it was my first time feeling confident about coding for an assignment. I knew the ins and outs of how it ran and how everything functioned and enjoyed doing it. After struggling on the last few labs on what some things meant, it was rewarding to code knowing what was occurring while still just seeing how things will go.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because I was very focused on trying to get everything to work. Though the steps seemed easy, actually writing the code and carefully making sure everything was written correctly and structured right was important. I remember having to retry over and over again to get it right, but I think thats where all the fun and determination for this assignment came from.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because I learned new concepts which I had struggled to understand until using them in the lab. Creating functions and calling them, using strings, and seeing the usage of if statements were all new for me to learn. While it took a lot of trial and error to get everything to work, Im proud to have eventually made the code work.
